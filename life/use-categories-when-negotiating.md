# Use categories when negotiation

A friend wants to get a promotion at BigCo. He hasn't been at the company very long, but has done tremendously well. He is currently a `Product Manager level 2`

They say that they can't give him a raise because he's already at the top of the pay-scale for a `PM level 2`, and they can't promote him to `PM level 3` because he's being promoted at the maximum speed that the org allows.

His strategy is to say the following:

> We both agree that I'm already contributing like a PM level 3. I'm frustrated that we can't give me the official title yet. One thing that we can do is give me the appropriate compensation for somebody at my level though.

This strategy pegs the negotiation to the higher salary range, and makes the category more clear.
